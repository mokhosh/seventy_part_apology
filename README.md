# seventy_part_apology

The 70 part apology of Imam Ali

Imam Ali (as) said:
> "Do I tell you about your malady and its remedy? Your malady is your sins, and its remedy is apologizing to God".

God has promised to forgive whoever repents and apologizes, but the problem is, we don't even consider many of our sins as sin, let alone apologize for them.

The 70 part apology of Imam Ali (as) helps us take a fresh look at our sins, and start our spiritual life a new by apologizing for them.
Don't forget us in your prayers.
